"""Match scored games to Dispatcharr channels / streams.

`_build_epg_lookup` (in plugin.py) supplies candidates from three sources:
  Path A - EPG ProgramData whose programme TITLE names a team, in the game's
           broadcast window (whole-channel: all the channel's streams attach).
  Path B - channels whose NAME names both teams (whole-channel).
  Path C - STREAMS whose name names both teams (stream-granular: only that one
           stream attaches, not the parent channel's others). Candidates carry
           a stream_id and a negative sentinel channel_id.

Tiers per game (match_games_to_channels):
  Tier 1 (regex_strict): a CHANNEL NAME (Path B) or STREAM NAME (Path C) names
     both teams. Highest confidence. MERGES the Tier-2 program-title both-team
     matches behind it (the live broadcasters) as fallback streams instead of
     discarding them.
  Tier 2 (regex_unique): exactly one non-preview programme title names both
     teams → match it.
  Tier 3 (llm / fallback_first): multiple or zero strict/title matches → Claude
     disambiguates (one batched call for all ambiguous games); with no API key,
     the first candidate is used.

The result splits matched targets into channel_ids (whole-channel) and
stream_ids (stream-granular Path C) via _partition_attach_targets.

# Competition nouns that end a TOURNAMENT name (#169). Field-event sources

# T-Mobile Polish Open' both reduced to 'Open' and matched a PDC darts channel
# ('European Tour 12 _ Czech Darts Open'), reported by a user on v1.16.0.
#
# Same family as the numeric case _is_weak_last_word already blocks ('UFC 329:
# ... Holloway 2' -> '2' -> 10593 tier-1 matches); that guard covers SHORT and

# No team is named for one of these, so suppressing the bonus token costs no

    names and numbers, so as a case-insensitive substring it matches almost
    everything. DO NOT emit it as a standalone keyword. This is exactly how a

    'UFC 329: McGregor vs. Holloway 2' -> last word '2' -> 10593 tier-1 matches
